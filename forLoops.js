//for loops is use for iterations/repetations of part of code
//loop save time as no need to write repetitive code
//first code block is run when condition is true then increment/updation happens after code block has been run 
//when updation happens lopp started again
//repetations of lopp depend on updation , when no updation then loop ended

//variable initialization ,condition, updation
for(i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    console.log(i)     //loop body / code block
}
console.log(i);        //loop stops when i = 5 so answer is 5!
