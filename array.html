        //it has 3 value ,the first value is target index from which addition or deletion starts
        //the second value is num of values to be removed from including targeted index
        //the third value is optional which allows to add values from the targeted index to be added to original array


        //example of splice

        var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        arr.splice(1,0,"Ahad","Zubair");
