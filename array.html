        //array allows to store multiple value in one variable
        //array may contain mix of different or same data  types
        //data type of array is object
        //index of array starts with zero

        // var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];
        // //INDEXING   0    ,   1   ,  2  ,  3

         //pop() method removes last value from array 
        
       
         //push method allows to add value(s) at end of array

        // var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        // arr.push("kamran" , "zeeshan") //can add multiple values as well

        // console.log(arr)

        // var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        // var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        // arr.unshift("Kamran" ," Zeeshan")

        // console.log(arr);

        //*splice method is little complex
        //it has 3 value ,the first value is target index from which addition or deletion starts
        //the second value is num of values to be removed from including targeted index
        //the third value is optional which allows to add values from the targeted index to be added to original array


        //example of splice

        // var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        // arr.splice(1,0,"Ahad","Zubair");

        // console.log(arr);




        //slice methos allows copyinf the array values

        //first value slice get is target index from which copying to be started

        //second value slice get is end index to which copying should be done but end index is given with plus 1 as it is rule

        //if the intention is to copy elements till end of array then end index not needed to be specified

        //slice example


        var arr = ["Ashar","Saad","Ali","Rehan"];

        console.log(arr.slice(0,2));
        console.log(arr.slice(2))
