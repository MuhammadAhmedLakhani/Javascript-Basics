//for of looponly works on an array
//iterates over array and bring its single element to a variable
//its a optimized version of loop and fast aswell
//use it when you donot need to have value of i (index) needed

var stu = ["ghous", "ahmed", "ali", "zain"];

for(var v of stu){
    console.log(v)    //printitng array element on each iteration
}
