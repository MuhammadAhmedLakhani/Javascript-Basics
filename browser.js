//browser
//like there is an object called 'location' which has values and methods

//'href' in location refers to url of page (in our case filepath)

console.log(window.location.href)

//getting the file path in our case as href value

// window.location.href =  "https://facebook.com"


//replacing the href value to facebook url


// location = "https://instagram.com"
